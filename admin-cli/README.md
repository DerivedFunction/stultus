# Admin Interface

The Admin's purpose is to create a Java program related to Database tasks; this means creating tables, dropping tables, being able to delete or edit messages. I've edited tutorial code to allow likes of posts/messages to be visible.

Test written for Admin functionality demonstrates creating a randomly generated String, adding that String as a new element in the table, ensuring the element has been added (as the last element), deleting it, and ensuring it's been deleted.
