## General questions



1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)?

   > Yes, how else did you read this?

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?

   > Yes, we did it on Wednesday to discuss team names, plans for future, etc.

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.

   > While the time is tight for this one, we were able to get all the diagrams done. I was able to update the `README.md` to include

   > what is required in the rubric. We are lucky that everyone knows what they are doing in our team.

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"



   > Everyone should be done with it.



5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"



   > No code review, but we tested how the pull requests work when we created pull requests to edit the `phase-1-README.md`.

   > In the future, pull requests are made to the `precheck` branch before being merged to `master`. That way we have a prelease and

   > and final working one.



6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?

   > Being active on Slack and communicating and giving hints help alot. Also, we are glad to be in a compentent team.

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?

   > Being active on Slack and communicating and giving hints help alot. Also, we are glad to be in a compentent team. Everyone can help

   > each other.

8. How well is the team communicating?

   > Giving status updates on Slack. Using the Jira board to track issues.

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.



   > Everyone is expected to do things on time and/or early and contribute. Better to ask questions for problems now

   > than to wait last minute.



10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.

    > Nothing yet.



## Project Management



Self-evaluation of PM performance



0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?



   > No, not yet. That is because this Sprint is due on Friday.



1. Describe your use of Trello. Did you have too much detail? Too little? Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?



   > Attempting to use Jira to keep track of issues. However, it takes time to get used to the clicking for roles, labels and stuff. That just seems tedious.



2. How did you conduct team meetings? How did your team interact outside of these meetings?

   > Meeting was conducted on Wednesdays on an agreed time and place. Outside those meetings, it is just Slack.

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.



   > We used Jira, Slack more often now that we can't just do things individually like the tutorials.



4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?



   > No difficulty, except that I have to leave Lehigh after 4:00 PM. I got other obligations to do. Therefore, unless Sprints are due Tuesday night, everything is separate.



5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?



   > We will attempt to create a mobile/desktop web/Chrome in our frontend. No mobile app.



6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.



   > Nothing for now. Maybe trying not to get ahead of ourselves, or lose points for minor mistakes.

   > At my house, the internet is significantly slow. I will try to download/upload big files at Lehigh.



7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?

   > I probably would suggest to use a template with filled in answers to save time. Maybe upload the git

   > `logs.txt` in a shared folder instead of slack.

   > Share things to our Shared Google Drive to keep track of things.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?

   > I don't think we did any time estimates. We just chugged along as much as possible.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?

   > No mobile app, just a mobile UI for our website. We have not been used to React yet.

   > Are we even going to use it???
