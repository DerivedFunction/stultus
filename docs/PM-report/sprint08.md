# Phase 2 Sprint 8 - PM Report Template
Use this form to provide your project manager report. 

<!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this section -->
## Instructions
Be as thorough and complete as possible, while being brief/concise. Please give detailed answers.

Submit one report per team. This should be submitted by the designated PM, except in approved circumstances. The report should be created as a markdown file (and converted to pdf if required).

In addition to uploading to coursesite, version control this in the `master` branch under the `docs` folder.

## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 
Yes
2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
Yes, two meetings, one Wednesday, scheduled by us, and one Tuesday, with our grader.

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.
    * Comment both on the sprint as a whole, as well as on the the individual members efforts.
    * Comment both on the app design as a whole, as well as on the design and implementation of individual components.
    * As PM, you should request each non-PM member to evaluate and report on how well requirements related to their efforts were met in this sprint. 
        * For example, how well did each member balance and make best use of their time across their individual work, as tutorial and group-work (including class time, if relevant).

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * If incomplete, what challenges are being overcome, how are they being overcome, and by when will the team member be able to finish?
    * If complete, how do you know everyone completed the work, and at a satisfactory level?

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * More details will follow on code reviews.
    * For now, report out on **when** (once? multiple times?) and **how** (in person? zoom? Watching a recording?) each member showed *and discussed* their progress.
        * Was this done individually with the PM, or together as a team?
        * Did you watch each other’s videos? Did you each look at each others’ jira boards and git commit history?
        * Did you notify each other via slack as you completed each tutorial?
        * Were these reviews scheduled, or "on-demand" / as completed?

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
This sprint was so short that there was not much to do for this, as there were only three days, and it took me the first to get organized. We just started work in class time, and continued during our meeting.
7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
Generally, this was done by assigning tasks to design and make documents based on areas of responsibility, so that my teammates could work out together how their parts ought to work between the technical stakeholders.
8. How well is the team communicating?
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * What is the nature of the conversations? Is it all business, or are you getting to know each other better in small and various ways?
    * Has one or more team members been communicating infrequently, only after a long delay, or in a non-transparent way? 
        * If so, what did you and/or the team do about this? How was this handled?
        * What was the reaction? 
        * Has communication improved?
The team is communicating pretty well, with good communication in person about who is doing what, but this is not translating to jira, where I am needing to document these conversations. Also, things are doing well on slack, with information moving as needed.
9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * Some examples you may have reached consensus on are: 
        * acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, 
        * frequency of asynchronous communication (e.g. slack), 
        * regularity of "live" check-ins (in person, or on e.g. zoom), 
        * turn-taking or "stage sharing" during live meetings, 
        * safe ways to express discomfort or disagreement should emotions or tensions flare.
One expectation that I tried to set, which is for the convience of code reviews, is that code reviews are requested more often on smaller pieces of code, potentially from branches made from specific commits instead of being all changes on a branch since the last merge, as otherwise some of the changes were a bit difficult to keep track of, especially with which commit they are related to 


10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.

## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?

1. Describe your use of Jira.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * Consider this an opportunity to run a mini [sprint retrospective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
      > A sprint retrospective is a separate meeting that allows team members to internally analyze strengths and weaknesses of the sprint, future areas of improvement, and continuous process improvement actions
    * An example of something you might "start" doing is including a retrospective at the end of each sprint, or checking in more frequently on slack, or respectfully checking in on expectations of eachother. 
    * An example of something you might "stop" is waiting three or more days to begin the sprint work.
    * An example of something you might "continue" is demonstrating open, honest, transparent communication.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
